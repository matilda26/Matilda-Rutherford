### Industrial Designer | Graphic Designer | Full Stack Web Developer
I am a visual person with a multifaceted background in design. I have extensive experience in brand development and graphic design, a Bachelors Degree in Industrial Design and I am currently studying Web Development at General Assembly. Previously, I have been employed at Himmelzimmer, an architecture studio, where I had been focused on producing all client interface comms, graphic design content and have extensively utilised my skills in 3d modelling software, such as Rhino and AutoCAD, to produce high-level architectural and graphic content. I have a deep passion for technology and design and look to utilise my skills to build web products that inspire and engage.
